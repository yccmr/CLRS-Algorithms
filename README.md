# CLRS-Algorithms

Consists of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python, most of which are covered in the algorithm courses from the University of Alberta (CMPUT 175, 204 and 304), which are all essentially constructed based on CLRS (Introduction To Algorithms).

The ones from CMPUT 175 and 204 will hopefully be done by Septemeber 2023, while the rest from 304 won't be uploaded until the end of 2024.

#### Sorting Algorithms (done): 

- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort w/ or w/o recursion
- merge sort
- quick sort & random quick sort



#### Data Structures (on-going):

- stack 
- queue
- singly & doubly linked list
- max heap
