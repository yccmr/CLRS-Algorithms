# CLRS-Algorithms

Consists of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python, most of which are covered in the algorithm courses (CMPUT 175 and 204) from the University of Alberta. These courses are all essentially constructed based on CLRS (Introduction To Algorithms).



#### Sorting Algorithms (done): 

- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort w/ or w/o recursion
- merge sort
- quick sort & random quick sort



#### Data Structures (done except for AVL tree):

- stack 
- queue
- singly & doubly linked list
- max heap
- binary search tree (BST)
- AVL tree - to do
- hash table
